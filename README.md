## Overview

*This repository contains a model for classifying dog and cat images. 
*The model is built using data science techniques.
*This project demonstrates how to preprocess cat and dog image data, transform it into numerical features, and train a classifier to classify whether it is a dog and cat.
*The classifier is trained using a classifier algorithm (e.g., CNN,Resnet-50,VGG) which extracts features from the SMS messages

## Dataset

*The dog and cat image collection dataset is used for training and evaluating the classifier. 
*This dataset consists of dog and cat images. 
*The dataset is inbuilt.



## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Libraries 

- Pandas:For using dataset
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Seaborn: For data visualization
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Sklearn: Simplifies machine learning implementation


## Getting Started Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Three Advanced Image Classifier:

Follow these steps to run the code and obtain 

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samyuktha343/BI-CAT-DOG-IMAGE-CLASSIFIER.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Three Advanced Image Classifier
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   We loaded cifar-10 datset which is inbuilt.

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Three Advanced Image Classifier.

   ```bash
   python Cat&DogImageClassifier.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing, classifying the cat and dog iamges.

7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into  Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Three Advanced Image Classifier.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file. Some of the key configurations include:

- `DATA_FILE`: Path to the input transaction data file.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.
- Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.

## Results

The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:

-Classifies cat and dog images using 3 advanced iamge classifiers with high accuracy.
